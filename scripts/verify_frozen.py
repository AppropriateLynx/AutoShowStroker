"""Open dist/GoonerApp.exe and check that what should be inside it actually is.

"It built" proves very little. The parts most likely to be missing are exactly the ones
import analysis cannot see: the device plugin is looked up by name at runtime, and
QtWebSockets is used only by that plugin. A build has already shipped without both of them,
with nothing to show for it but a line in the log - so this exists to make that loud.

It also compares the bundled VERSION against the repo's, which catches the other easy
mistake: publishing yesterday's executable.

Reads the archive rather than launching anything, so it is quick and needs no display.
